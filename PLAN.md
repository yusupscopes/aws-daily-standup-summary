# üóìÔ∏è Daily Standup Summary Automation ‚Äî Cloud Native AWS Plan (Python + GitLab + CloudFormation + SNS)

A serverless application that collects a software engineer's daily tasks, schedules, commits, and tickets from Notion, Google Calendar, GitLab, and Jira. It summarizes the information using OpenAI and sends a report via Amazon SNS every weekday at 9:00 AM.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Project Setup & Scheduling

**Goal**: Set up the foundational infrastructure and scheduling.

### Tasks
- [x] Create Python project using hexagonal structure:
  - `app/domain/` (ports, model, exceptions, commands, command_handlers)
  - `app/adapters/` (external service adapters)
  - `app/entrypoints/` (lambda handler)
  - `app/libraries/` (shared utilities)
- [x] Initialize Github repo
- [x] Create CloudFormation template for:
  - [x] EventBridge scheduled rule (e.g. cron: 9:00 AM WIB)
  - [x] Lambda function and execution role
  - [x] SNS topic and policy
- [x] Deploy skeleton function with logging

### Deliverables
- [x] `infra/template.yaml`
- [x] `app/entrypoints/lambda_handler.py`
- [x] `scripts/deploy.sh`
- [x] IAM policies for SNS, EventBridge
